To Be Implemented:
===================
-only use .note files and hide file endings on display
-add tags to files (first without functionality)
-allow viewing and editing tags
-save files with DM tag to separate directory, automatically add the tag when reading the file
-allow filtering for tags (first search bar implementation)
-allow changing file name
-allow undoing changes (like deletion or name change)
	idea: a separate "temp/toDelete" directory that is emptied on shutdown
-allow saving with ctrl+S
-show separate list of related notes (based on tags)
-allow linking other notes to the one you edit (a simply list of note names as part of the Note object)
